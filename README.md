# Bare Server Written in Rust

An implementation of the [TompHTTP Bare Server V1 Specification](https://github.com/tomphttp/specifications/blob/master/BareServerV1.md) in Rust.

This is highly work in progress and does not completely work. Simple HTTP
requests somewhat work. A basic Ultraviolet frontend works with simple HTTP and
some HTTPS sites. More debugging still needs to be done and work needs to be started on the Web Socket API.

## TODO
- Fix/Debug proxied requests.
- Implement the Web Socket routes.
